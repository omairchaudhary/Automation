# Project Title: Automation System with MQTT Integration and Web Control

## Project Overview:
The completed project involves creating an automation system that employs MQTT for communication between hardware devices and a web-based interface 
developed using PHP. Users can remotely control and monitor connected devices through the web interface.

## Components:
### Hardware Setup:

Selected and configured hardware components for automation, such as lights, fans, and sensors.
Integrated microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi) with the devices.
Implemented necessary circuitry, including relays for appliance control.
### MQTT Broker:

Established an MQTT broker/server (e.g., Mosquitto) as a communication hub.
### MQTT Communication:

Programmed microcontrollers/boards to establish MQTT connections with the broker.
Implemented MQTT publish and subscribe functionalities.
Validated MQTT communication to ensure devices could exchange messages.
### Web Interface (PHP):

Developed a user authentication system using PHP and a database.
Designed a user-friendly web interface displaying device statuses and control options.
Integrated MQTT communication in PHP using libraries like Eclipse Paho.


## Project Completion Steps:

### Hardware Setup:

Identified devices for automation.
Chose appropriate microcontrollers/development boards.
Set up circuitry for device interfacing.
### MQTT Implementation:

Programmed microcontrollers/boards to communicate with the MQTT broker.
Implemented publish/subscribe logic for relevant MQTT topics.
Verified proper message exchange between devices and the broker.
### Web Interface Development:

Created user authentication using PHP and a database.
Designed an intuitive web interface for device control and monitoring.
Integrated MQTT communication into PHP for real-time updates.
### Integration:

Connected the web interface to the MQTT broker for seamless communication.
Conducted end-to-end testing to ensure device control and status updates were functional.

## Project Outcome:
The completed project offers a user-friendly automation system where users can log into a web interface, monitor device statuses, 
and remotely control devices through MQTT communication. 
This project demonstrates proficiency in hardware integration, MQTT protocol usage, and web development skills.
